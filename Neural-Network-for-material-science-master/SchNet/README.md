# SchNet_for_metals
A modified version of the original SchNet. It can be used to predict the properties of metals.

the usage of code:

pyg_graph_generation: transform the atomic configurations to PyTorch-Geometric Data.

Schnet_pyg_mod: The definition of SchNet using PyTorch-Geometric, together with the training, validation and test process.

config_search: Searching the atomic configurations with certain properties using generic algorithm. 

data_example: An example of data sample to be processed by pyg_graph_generation. 


Prerequisites:

Anaconda

PyTorch

PyTorch-Geometric
